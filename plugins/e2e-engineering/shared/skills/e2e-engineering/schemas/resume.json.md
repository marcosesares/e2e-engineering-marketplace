# Schema — resume.json

Machine-readable resume pointers for one Task. **caveman:ultra field values only — no narrative** (ADR 0022: NOT a handoff doc, NOT a context checkpoint). Lives at Task root: `.e2e-engineering/tasks/<id>/resume.json`. Sole writer = orchestrator. Written **write-ahead** — BEFORE each phase transition and before every long-running gate step; updated after completion. Read at flight Step 2 before anything else.

Stale on resume is SAFE by construction: values are only written before an action, so a stale value can only cause an already-done step to be re-verified — never skipped unsafely.

## Rules

- **Write-ahead.** Update BEFORE dispatch/spawn/merge/gate-step; the commit right after is the resume point. Death between write and commit → the manifest/brief on disk still replays (journal-before-dispatch, ADR 0034).
- **Sole writer.** Only orchestrator. Sub-agents never touch it.
- **Fields stay minimal.** Pointers only — shas, ids, paths, counts. No summaries, no learnings (those live in `progress.txt`).
- **Reconcile on resume:** `dispatched[]` entry with no manifest/sidecar on disk → follow the committed-but-unrecorded path (branch ahead → treat head as result; zero commits → reset to `todo`). `teardownOwed=true` → teardown first.
- **Delete or reset at task close** (with `progress.txt` + `prd.json` cleanup). Never carry into the next Task.
- **`bounce.rounds` is DURABLE and never reset** (ADR 0035). Not on resume, and not when a re-review surfaces brand-new findings — the counter is absolute per slice. Losing it restarts the count and the slice churns unbounded; same failure class as `gate5Strikes`. Write-ahead before every bounce dispatch.
- **`verifyWave[]` written BEFORE verifier dispatch.** On resume, an entry with no `verification` recorded in that slice's `review-result.json` → re-dispatch that verifier ONCE; still nothing → record `inconclusive`, which counts as `refuted`.
- **`suppressed[]` holds `dropped-refuted` finding keys** for the slice in flight, formatted `"<severity>|<location>|<first 8 hex of sha1(message)>"`. A later re-review may NOT re-raise a suppressed finding — without this the convergence loop never terminates. Cleared when the slice merges.
- `ports.nextFree` — the port allocator ledger (conditional docker/Testcontainers projects). `run-focused-tests.ps1` claims a port by incrementing write-ahead and releases it on exit; never hand-assign. Compose-stack scripts (`carrier-smoke.ps1`) use the stack's own ports — no ledger claim.
- `concurrency` — the Step-0 RAM/CPU probe result; caps concurrent `subagent` dispatch + workflow parallelism for this flight.
- **`bounce`, `verifyWave[]` and `suppressed` are keyed PER SLICE** — the impl wave dispatches the whole ready set in parallel, so two slices can be in their review waves at once. A single shared counter would let one slice reset another's `rounds` (unbounded churn) or clear another's `suppressed` (refuted findings re-enter and the loop never converges). Delete a slice's entry when that slice merges; never reset the whole object.
