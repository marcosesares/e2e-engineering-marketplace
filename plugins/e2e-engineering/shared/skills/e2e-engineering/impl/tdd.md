# tdd — SLICE SUBAGENT

Runs INSIDE fan-out sub-agent, in own git worktree, for ONE story. Receives: [constitution](../constitution.md), story (acceptanceCriteria, sliceType, depends_on, `integration` decision), feature test-cases, (brownfield) SCOPED slice of ARCHITECTURE.md (this layer's naming + ownership rules touching blast radius + relevant anti-patterns — via §Index offset/limit). Follow `integration` decision and those conventions: EXTEND named owner, match naming pattern — do not invent parallel class/file. Returns evidence-pointer-first manifest only — never writes prd.json/progress.txt/ARCHITECTURE.md or authoritative sidecars (orchestrator is sole writer; ARCHITECTURE.md is human-phase-only).

**After returning green, orchestrator runs expert-review wave** (role agents: frontend-reviewer / backend-architect / dba / test-reviewer, by sliceType — ADR 0022) in this worktree before merge. Critical/Important findings bounce back to YOU for fix, then re-review (cap 3 round-trips, then slice marked `blocked`). Write slice to pass that review: follow `integration` decision, match conventions, give every acceptance criterion real-interface test.

## Sequence

### 1. Slice gap-check (FIRST move, before any TDD)
Validate story is implementable:
- Acceptance criteria clear?
- `testCases[]` present?
- `depends_on` real and satisfied (upstream code exists in this worktree)?
Gap found → escalate ONE question to orchestrator. DO NOT guess.

### 2. Red-green-refactor
- **RED** — write failing test FIRST for behavior in acceptance criteria. Run it; confirm fails for right reason. **HARD GATE 2: no production code before failing test.**
- **GREEN** — write minimum production code to pass. Constitution: simplicity-first (new code), surgical-changes (editing existing).
- **REFACTOR** — clean up with tests green. Stay in scope (no "while I'm here").

### 3. Automate FEATURE e2e
Automate story's **feature** test-case(s) as executable E2E in project stack (Playwright for web UI). Regression cases NOT yours — final e2e-loop handles cross-slice journeys. Map each E2E back to its test-case id.

### 4. Debug escalation (HARD GATE 3)
Fix fails 3 times → STOP. Do not blind-retry. Return to orchestrator reporting 3-strike. Orchestrator re-dispatches ONCE with [systematic-debugging](./systematic-debugging.md).

## Return manifest (to orchestrator)
Return compact JSON only: `sliceId`, `status`, one-line `summary`, `testsPassed`, `branch`, `evidencePaths[]`, `findings[]`.

- Put detailed logs in normal test/build report paths or assigned per-slice evidence paths; return pointers only.
- Include test-case ids and red→green proof in evidence artifacts, not chat.
- Durable learnings / architecture drift go in `findings[]` as concise warnings. Do NOT edit ARCHITECTURE.md — orchestrator stages it; human decides at QA gate.
- Blockers / gap-check escalations go in `findings[]` with `type:blocker`.
- Keep final response tiny — orchestrator reads manifests, not raw churn.

## Red flags (stop)
- Production code before failing test (gate 2 violation).
- Guessing past gap instead of escalating one question.
- Blind-retrying 4th time after 3 strikes (gate 3 violation).
- Writing prd.json / progress.txt (sole-writer violation).
- Returning raw test logs, full diffs, or long narrative instead of evidence paths.
- Automating regression/cross-slice journeys here (not this sub-agent's job).
- Testing internal state instead of real interfaces (constitution testing principle 1).
- Creating parallel class/file when `integration` decision or ARCHITECTURE.md names existing owner to extend.
- Editing ARCHITECTURE.md (human-phase-only; propose drift in summary instead).
